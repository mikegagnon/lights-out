# Becoming dangerous in JS + HTML + CSS

If you’d like to know just enough to become dangerous, I have a project for you.
Overall, my approach in these lecture notes is to throw you in the deep end, and show you just enough
to keep your head above water.

We will make a game together called Lights Out, while learning the bare essentials of JS + HTML + CSS.
I assume you’ve already taken [Codecademy’s JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript).
