# Becoming dangerous in JS + HTML + CSS

> "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing." — Alexander Pope

If you’d like to know just enough programming to be dangerous, I have a project for you. We will make a game together called Lights Out, while learning the bare essentials of JS + HTML + CSS.
I assume you’ve already taken [Codecademy’s JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript).

Overall, my approach in these lecture notes is to throw you in the deep end, and show you just enough
to keep your head above water. In that spirit: [learn the game Lights Out](https://mikegagnon.github.io/lights-out/).
